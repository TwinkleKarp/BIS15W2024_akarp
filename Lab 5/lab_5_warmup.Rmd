## 1. Load the fish data. 

```{r}
fish <- read_csv("data/Gaeta_etal_CLC_data.csv")
```


## 2. Transform the fish data to only include the variables lakeid and length.  Store this as a new dataframe called "fishlength". 

```{r}
names(fish)
```


```{r}
fishlength <- select(fish, "lakeid", "length") #use 'select()' since involves variables/columns
fishlength
```


## 3. Filter the `fish` data to include the samples from lake "BO".  

```{r}
glimpse(fish) #used to see the different rows for reference
```


```{r}
fish_bo <- filter(fish, lakeid == "BO")
```


## 4. Calculate the mean length of fish from lake "BO".  

```{r}
mean(fish_bo$length)
```
